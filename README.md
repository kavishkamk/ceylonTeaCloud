# Ceylon Tea Cloud ☕:cloud:
This is a cloud-based service platform which will be implemented to make the connection comfortable between the tea fatories in Sri Lanka and their growers.

☑️ This service will avoid current occuring challenges in the traditional system and will make ease of use.

☑️ The main deliverables of this project are,
  - generating monthly reports and sending to the corresponding grower
  - generating requesting letters (loans, fertilizer, tea packets etc.) and sending to the factory admins
  - sending notifications about pending and confirmed requesting letters etc.

☑️ Programming languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Bootstrap, MySQL and the IBM cloud platform will be used to implement this Platform as a Service (PaaS).
